Element Battle is new take on the traditional rock, paper scissors game, where instead of 3 choices, the player has four choices to decide from. This simple online game, uses the 4 main elements: fire, water, earth and air to battle against the computer player. You must master the 4 elements and try to best the computer. This simple game is suitable for all ages, with its simple to understand rules.

# Features
### Header
The header is featuered at the top of the page, which shows the game name: ELEMENT BATTLE. It is in a font and colour that clearly contrasts with the background, so it's easily read by the user.

### Rules Section
The rules section clearly explains how each element matches up against each other, so the user/player doesn't get confused on why they lost or won.

### The Game Options
The game options has a choice of options for the user to choose from to pick against the computer, which are: Fire, Water, Earth and Air. These buttons are interactable, meaning the user can click on them to make their choice. Not to mention the buttons change colour to the respected elemental colours when the user hovers over them.

### The Game Results
The game results show a range of results that the user/player can easily read, which include the options that the player and computer picked, as well as who won the battle/round. This section also includes a scoreboard, where the player can see how many times they or the computer have won, as well as the number of times they have got a tie/draw. The computer's results are randomly chosen by the computer using a Javascript code.

## Future Features

In the future, I would like to expand upon this game to include other elements that are not necessarily mainstream, such as lightning or grass.

### Javascript Validation
